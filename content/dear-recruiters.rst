:title: Dear Recruiters


Dear Recruiters,

You are probably reading this because I sent you a link in response to a recent job you contacted me about. Since most of you know nothing about me (even though most of this information is on my `LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/in/kencochrane>`_ page). I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself, and after reading this if you feel the job that you are trying to fill, is a good match for me, then feel free to respond. If you are going to respond, please make sure you follow the criteria I listed at the bottom of the page.

About Me:
=========

I currently work for a great company called `dotCloud <http://www.dotcloud.com>`_, which is based in San Francisco, and I'm happy. So it would take a really good offer to even make me think about wanting to leave. What is a really good offer you might ask? I list my current minimum offer towards the bottom of the page.

Even though the company that I work for is based in San Francisco, I do not live there, I live in `Southern Maine <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Maine>`_. So, unless this job of yours allows remote workers, don't even bother. Also, unless you plan on covering the cost of selling my house, don't even mention relocation assistance.

I like the following:

- **Language**: Python
- **Server OS**: Linux
- **Desktop OS**: OSX
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Data Stores**: Redis, MongoDB
- **Version control**: git, mercurial 
- **Web Server**: nginx
- **Javascript library**: jQuery
    
The following are deal breakers for me. If I have to work with the following technologies. Don't even bother.

- PHP
- .NET
- Microsoft Windows (any flavor)


Minimum offer:
==============
**Note**: I don't make this today, but like I said before, it would need to be a really good offer before I would consider leaving my current job.

    **Salary**: $200,000+

    **Vacation**: 6 weeks

    **Signing bonus**: $25,000+ including Stock options

    **Company**: Needs to be technology company doing cool and exciting things. I prefer smaller companies, and don't want to work for a big company that has lots of office politics that get in the way of getting things done.

Offer Criteria:
===============

If you have read all of the above, and you still feel you have a job that is right for me, then please send me the following information. **Failure to do so, will result in your message getting deleted with no reply.**

1. The name of the company and their location
2. The salary. (Don't say, it depends on experience, look at my `LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/in/kencochrane>`_ profile, figure out how much experience I have and then tell me the salary you are offering.)
3. A description of the job you would like me to apply for.
4. The list of the current technologies related to the job in question.

If I read your message and I find it interesting, I will be in contact. If you don't hear from me, assume I'm not interested and please don't keep badgering me. It isn't very becoming of you.

Sincerely,

Ken Cochrane
